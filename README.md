# insta-follow
Python program that aims to get you more likes and follows on your instagram account
## Installing
For the selenium implementation, you must have selenium installed and the selenium firefox webdriver  
First clone the package by entering this in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/OmriHab/insta-follow.git
```
Then cd into the folder `cd insta-follow/requests_implementation` and to run, run `python insta_req`  
If it doesn't work for you, try the selenium implementation. Change to that directory and run `python follow_me.py`  
  
Leave it running for a few hours and come back for a nice suprise :)
